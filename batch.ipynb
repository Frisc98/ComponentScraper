      " A stack is a linear data structure in which the insertion of a new element and removal of an existing element takes place at the same end represented as the top of the stack.To implement the stack, it is required to maintain the pointer to the top of the stack, which is the last element to be inserted because we can access the elements only on the top of the stack.LIFO( Last In First Out ):This strategy states that the element that is inserted last will come out first. You can take a pile of plates kept on top of each other as a real-life example. The plate which we put last is on the top and since we remove the plate that is at the top, we can say that the plate that was put last comes out first.In order to make manipulations in a stack, there are certain operations provided to us.StackAdds an item to the stack. If the stack is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition.Algorithm for push:Removes an item from the stack. The items are popped in the reversed order in which they are pushed. If the stack is empty, then it is said to be an Underflow condition.Algorithm for pop:Returns the top element of the stack.Algorithm for Top:Returns true if the stack is empty, else false.Algorithm for isEmpty:There are many real-life examples of a stack. Consider the simple example of plates stacked over one another in a canteen. The plate which is at the top is the first one to be removed, i.e. the plate which has been placed at the bottommost position remains in the stack for the longest period of time. So, it can be simply seen to follow the LIFO/FILO order.In addition to these two main types, there are several other variations of Stacks, including:A stack can be implemented using an array or a linked list. In an array-based implementation, the push operation is implemented by incrementing the index of the top element and storing the new element at that index. The pop operation is implemented by decrementing the index of the top element and returning the value stored at that index. In a linked list-based implementation, the push operation is implemented by creating a new node with the new element and setting the next pointer of the current top node to the new node. The pop operation is implemented by setting the next pointer of the current top node to the next node and returning the value of the current top node.Stacks are commonly used in computer science for a variety of applications, including the evaluation of expressions, function calls, and memory management. In the evaluation of expressions, a stack can be used to store operands and operators as they are processed. In function calls, a stack can be used to keep track of the order in which functions are called and to return control to the correct function when a function returns. In memory management, a stack can be used to store the values of the program counter and the values of the registers in a computer program, allowing the program to return to the previous state when a function returns.In conclusion, a Stack is a linear data structure that operates on the LIFO principle and can be implemented using an array or a linked list. The basic operations that can be performed on a stack include push, pop, and peek, and stacks are commonly used in computer science for a variety of applications, including the evaluation of expressions, function calls, and memory management.There are two ways to implement a stack –Related Articles: \n",

      " Circular Doubly Linked List has properties of both doubly linked list and circular linked list in which two consecutive elements are linked or connected by the previous and next pointer and the last node points to the first node by the next pointer and also the first node points to the last node by the previous pointer.Following is the representation of a Circular doubly linked list node in C/C++:Circular Doubly Linked LIstA node(Say N) is inserted with data = 5. So, the previous pointer of N points to N and the next pointer of N also points to N. But now start pointer points to the first node of the list.Insertion in an empty listA node(Say M) is inserted with data = 7, so the previous pointer of M points to the last node, the next pointer of M points to the first node and the last node’s next pointer points to this M node, and first node’s previous pointer points to this M node.Insertion at the end of listBelow is the implementation of the above operations:To insert a node at the beginning of the list, create a node(Say T) with data = 5, T next pointer points to the first node of the list, T previous pointer points to the last node of the list, last node’s next pointer points to this T node, first node’s previous pointer also points this T node and at last don’t forget to shift ‘Start’ pointer to this T node.Insertion at the beginning of the listBelow is the implementation of the above operation:To insert a node in between the list, two data values are required one after which new node will be inserted and another is the data of the new node.Insertion in between other nodesBelow is the implementation of the above operation:Following is a complete program that uses all of the above methods to create a circular doubly linked list.Time Complexity: O(N)Auxiliary Space: O(1), As constant extra space is used.This article is contributed by Akash Gupta.

      " The circular linked list is a linked list where all nodes are connected to form a circle. In a circular linked list, the first node and the last node are connected to each other which forms a circle. There is no NULL at the end.There are generally two types of circular linked lists:Representation of Circular singly linked listRepresentation of circular doubly linked listNote: We will be using the singly circular linked list to represent the working of the circular linked list.Circular linked lists are similar to single Linked Lists with the exception of connecting the last node to the first node.Node representation of a Circular Linked List:Example of Circular singly linked list:Example of  circular linked listThe above  Circular singly linked list can be represented as:Explanation: In the above program one, two, and three are the node with values 3, 5, and 9 respectively which are connected in a circular manner as:We can do some operations on the circular linked list similar to the singly linked list which are:A node can be added in three ways:1) Insertion at the beginning of the list: To insert a node at the beginning of the list, follow these steps:Circular linked list before insertionAnd then,Circular linked list after insertion2) Insertion at the end of the list: To insert a node at the end of the list, follow these steps:Before insertion,Circular linked list before insertion of node at the endAfter insertion,Circular linked list after insertion of node at the end3) Insertion in between the nodes: To insert a node in between the two nodes, follow these steps:Suppose 12 needs to be inserted after the node has the value 10,Circular linked list before insertionAfter searching and insertion,Circular linked list after  insertion1) Delete the node only if it is the only node in the circular linked list:2) Deletion of the last node:3) Delete any node from the circular linked list: We will be given a node and our task is to delete that node from the circular linked list.Algorithm:Case 1: List is empty.Case 2:List is not emptyBelow is the implementation for the above approach:Time Complexity: O(N), Worst case occurs when the element to be deleted is the last element and we need to move through the whole list.Auxiliary Space: O(1), As constant extra space is used.Next Posts: Circular Linked List | Set 2 (Traversal) Circular Singly Linked List | Insertion Please write comments if you find any bug in above code/algorithm, or find other ways to solve the same problemSolve DSA problems on GfG Practice. \n",

      " A matrix is a two-dimensional array that consists of rows and columns. It is an arrangement of elements in horizontal or vertical lines of entries.Introduction to Matrix or Grid – Data Structure and Algorithms TutorialsThe syntax of declaring a Matrix or two-dimensional array is very much similar to that of a one-dimensional array, given as follows.However, It produces a data structure that looks like the following:Representation of matrixAs you can see from the above image, the elements are organized in rows and columns. As shown in the above image the cell x[0][0] is the first element of the first row and first column. The value in the first square bracket represents the row number and the value inside the second square bracket represents the column number. (i.e, x[row][column]).There are two methods to initialize two-dimensional arrays.Method 1int arr[4][3]={1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 20, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120};Method 2int arr[4][3]={{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {20, 80, 90}, {100, 110, 120}};Here are two methods of initialization of an element during declaration. Here, the second method is preferred because the second method is more readable and understandable so that you can visualize that arr[][] comprises four rows and three columns.Like one-dimensional arrays, matrices can be accessed randomly by using their indices to access the individual elements. A cell has two indices, one for its row number, and the other for its column number. We can use X[i][j] to access the element which is at the ith row and jth column of the matrix.MatrixThe syntax for access element from the matrix which is at the ith row and jth column:Printing elements of a matrix or two-dimensional array can be done using two “for” loops.Given a matrix mat[][] of size N x M, where every row and column is sorted in increasing order, and a number X is given. The task is to find whether element X is present in the matrix or not.Examples:Input : mat[][] = { {1, 5, 9},                    {14, 20, 21},                    {30, 34, 43} }       x = 14Output : YESInput : mat[][] = { {1, 5, 9, 11},                    {14, 20, 21, 26},                    {30, 34, 43, 50} }       x = 42Output : NOSolution:There are a lot of ways to solve this problem but let’s discuss the idea of a very naive or brute-force approach here.A Simple Solution is to one by one compare x with every element of the matrix. If matches, then return true. If we reach the end then return false. The time complexity of this solution is O(n x m).Below is the implementation of the above idea:Time Complexity: O(M*N), where M and N are the numbers of rows and columns respectively.Auxiliary Space: O(1)Given a 2D square matrix, print the Principal and Secondary diagonals.Examples :Input: 1 2 3 44 3 2 17 8 9 66 5 4 3Output:Principal Diagonal: 1, 3, 9, 3Secondary Diagonal: 4, 2, 8, 6Input:1 1 11 1 11 1 1Output:Principal Diagonal: 1, 1, 1Secondary Diagonal: 1, 1, 1Solution:The primary diagonal is formed by the elements A00, A11, A22, A33.Condition for Principal Diagonal: The row-column condition is row = column.The secondary diagonal is formed by the elements A03, A12, A21, A30. Condition for Secondary Diagonal: The row-column condition is row = numberOfRows – column -1.Time Complexity: O(n2), As there is a nested loop involved so the time complexity is squared.Auxiliary Space: O(1).Given a n x n matrix. The problem is to sort the given matrix in strict order. Here strict order means that the matrix is sorted in a way such that all elements in a row are sorted in increasing order and for row ‘i’, where 1 <= i <= n-1, the first element of row ‘i’ is greater than or equal to the last element of row ‘i-1’.Examples:Input : mat[][] = { {5, 4, 7},                          {1, 3, 8},                         {2, 9, 6} }Output : 1 2 3             4 5 6             7 8 9Solution:The idea to solve this proble is Create a temp[] array of size n^2. Starting with the first row one by one copy the elements of the given matrix into temp[]. Sort temp[]. Now one by one copy the elements of temp[] back to the given matrix.Below is the implementation:Time Complexity: O(n2log2n). Auxiliary Space: O(n2), since n * n extra space has been taken.Given a square matrix, the task is that turn it by 180 degrees in an anti-clockwise direction without using any extra space.Examples :Input :  1  2  3        4  5  6        7  8  9Output : 9 8 7         6 5 4         3 2 1Input :  1 2 3 4         5 6 7 8         9 0 1 2         3 4 5 6 Output : 6 5 4 3         2 1 0 9         8 7 6 5         4 3 2 1Solution:There are four steps that are required to solve this problem:1- Find the transpose of a matrix. 2- Reverse columns of the transpose. 3- Find the transpose of a matrix. 4- Reverse columns of the transposeIllustration:Let the given matrix be1  2  3  45  6  7  89  10 11 1213 14 15 16First we find transpose.1 5 9 132 6 10 143 7 11 154 8 12 16Then we reverse elements of every column.4 8 12 163 7 11 152 6 10 141 5  9 13then transpose again 4 3 2 1 8 7 6 5 12 11 10 916 15 14 13Then we reverse elements of every column again16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1Below is the implementation:Time complexity: O(R*C) Auxiliary Space: O(1)Given a matrix mat[][] having n rows and m columns. We need to find unique elements in the matrix i.e, those elements not repeated in the matrix or those whose frequency is 1.Examples:Input :  20  15  30  2        2   3   5   30        6   7   6   8Output : 3  20  5  7  8  15Input :  1  2  3          5  6  2        1  3  5        6  2  2Output : No unique element in the matrixSolution:The idea is to use hashing and traverse through all the elements of the matrix, If an element is present in the dictionary, then increment its count. Otherwise insert an element with value = 1.Below is the implementation:Time Complexity: O(m*n) where m is the number of rows & n is the number of columns.Auxiliary Space: O(max(matrix)).Related Article:Solve DSA problems on GfG Practice. \n",

      " Generic trees are a collection of nodes where each node is a data structure that consists of records and a list of references to its children(duplicate references are not allowed). Unlike the linked list, each node stores the address of multiple nodes. Every node stores address of its children and the very first node’s address will be stored in a separate pointer called root.The Generic trees are the N-ary trees which have the following properties:1. Many children at every node.2. The number of nodes for each node is not known in advance.Example:Generic TreeTo represent the above tree, we have to consider the worst case, that is the node with maximum children (in above example, 6 children) and allocate that many pointers for each node.The node representation based on this method can be written as:Disadvantages of the above representation are:Simple Approach:For storing the address of children in a node we can use an array or linked list. But we will face some issues with both of them.Better Approach:We can use Dynamic Arrays for storing the address of children. We can randomly access any child’s address and the size of the vector is also not fixed.First child / Next sibling representationIn the first child/next sibling representation, the steps taken are:At each node-link the children of the same parent(siblings) from left to right.Since we have a link between children, we do not need extra links from parents to all the children. This representation allows us to traverse all the elements by starting at the first child of the parent.FIRST CHILD/NEXT SIBLING REPRESENTATIONThe node declaration for first child / next sibling representation can be written as:Advantages:Height of generic tree from parent array Generic tree – level order traversalSolve DSA problems on GfG Practice.S \n",

      " An AVL tree defined as a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) where the difference between heights of left and right subtrees for any node cannot be more than one.The difference between the heights of the left subtree and the right subtree for any node is known as the balance factor of the node.The AVL tree is named after its inventors, Georgy Adelson-Velsky and Evgenii Landis, who published it in their 1962 paper “An algorithm for the organization of information”.AVL treeThe above tree is AVL because the differences between the heights of left and right subtrees for every node are less than or equal to 1.An AVL tree may rotate in one of the following four ways to keep itself balanced:Left Rotation:When a node is added into the right subtree of the right subtree, if the tree gets out of balance, we do a single left rotation.Left-Rotation in AVL treeRight Rotation:If a node is added to the left subtree of the left subtree, the AVL tree may get out of balance, we do a single right rotation.Right Rotation in AVL treeLeft-Right Rotation:A left-right rotation is a combination in which first left rotation takes place after that right rotation executes.Left-Right Rotation in AVL treeRight-Left Rotation:A right-left rotation is a combination in which first right rotation takes place after that left rotation executes.Right-Left Rotation in AVL treeRelated Articles:Solve DSA problems on GfG Practice. \n",

      " A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node can have at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.The topmost node in a binary tree is called the root, and the bottom-most nodes are called leaves. A binary tree can be visualized as a hierarchical structure with the root at the top and the leaves at the bottom.Binary trees have many applications in computer science, including data storage and retrieval, expression evaluation, network routing, and game AI. They can also be used to implement various algorithms such as searching, sorting, and graph algorithms.Each node in the tree contains the following:Binary TreeIn C, we can represent a tree node using structures. In other languages, we can use classes as part of their OOP feature. Below is an example of a tree node with integer data.Tree Traversal algorithms can be classified broadly into two categories:Let us traverse the following tree with all four traversal methods:Binary TreePre-order Traversal of the above tree: 1-2-4-5-3-6-7In-order Traversal of the above tree: 4-2-5-1-6-3-7Post-order Traversal of the above tree: 4-5-2-6-7-3-1Level-order Traversal of the above tree: 1-2-3-4-5-6-7Let us create a simple tree with 4 nodes. The created tree would be as follows.Binary TreeBelow is the Implementation of the binary tree:Tree is a hierarchical data structure. Main uses of trees include maintaining hierarchical data, providing moderate access and insert/delete operations. Binary trees are special cases of tree where every node has at most two children.Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above.Solve DSA problems on GfG Practice. \n",

      " A queue is a linear data structure that is open at both ends and the operations are performed in First In First Out (FIFO) order.We define a queue to be a list in which all additions to the list are made at one end, and all deletions from the list are made at the other end.  The element which is first pushed into the order, the delete operation is first performed on that.FIFO property of queueLike stacks, Queues can also be represented in an array: In this representation, the Queue is implemented using the array. Variables used in this case areArray representation of queue:A queue can also be represented using following entities:There are different types of queues:To learn more about different types of queues, read the article on “Types of Queues“.Some of the basic operations for Queue in Data Structure are:There are a few supporting operations (auxiliary operations):Enqueue() operation in Queue adds (or stores) an element to the end of the queue.The following steps should be taken to enqueue (insert) data into a queue:Enqueue representationImplementation of Enqueue:Removes (or access) the first element from the queue.The following steps are taken to perform the dequeue operation:Dequeue operationImplementation of dequeue:This operation returns the element at the front end without removing it.This operation returns the element at the rear end without removing it.This operation returns a boolean value that indicates whether the queue is empty or not.This operation returns a boolean value that indicates whether the queue is full or not.Queue can be implemented using following data structures:We have discussed the Structure implementation of Queue below:Time complexity: All the operations have O(1) time complexity.Auxiliary Space: O(N)Application of queue is common. In a computer system, there may be queues of tasks waiting for the printer, for access to disk storage, or even in a time-sharing system, for use of the CPU. Within a single program, there may be multiple requests to be kept in a queue, or one task may create other tasks, which must be done in turn by keeping them in a queue.Priority queues can be implemented using a variety of data structures, including linked lists, arrays, binary search trees, and heaps. Priority queues are best implemented using the heap data structure.In addition to making your data persistent, queues reduce errors that occur when different parts of your system are down.In a double-ended queue, elements can be inserted and removed at both ends.If you want things to come out in the order you put them in, use a queue. Stacks are useful when you want to reorder things after putting them in.Related articles:Solve DSA problems on GfG Practice. \n",

      " B + Tree is a variation of the B-tree data structure. In a B + tree, data pointers are stored only at the leaf nodes of the tree. In a B+ tree structure of a leaf node differs from the structure of internal nodes. The leaf nodes have an entry for every value of the search field, along with a data pointer to the record (or to the block that contains this record). The leaf nodes of the B+ tree are linked together to provide ordered access to the search field to the records. Internal nodes of a B+ tree are used to guide the search. Some search field values from the leaf nodes are repeated in the internal nodes of the B+ tree.Some differences between B+ Tree and B Tree are stated below.ParametersB+ TreeB TreeStructureSeparate leaf nodes for data storage and internal nodes for indexingNodes store both keys and data valuesLeaf NodesLeaf nodes form a linked list for efficient range-based queriesLeaf nodes do not form a linked listOrderHigher order (more keys)Lower order (fewer keys)Key DuplicationTypically allows key duplication in leaf nodesUsually does not allow key duplicationDisk AccessBetter disk access due to sequential reads in a linked list structureMore disk I/O due to non-sequential reads in internal nodesApplicationsDatabase systems, file systems, where range queries are commonIn-memory data structures, databases, general-purpose useareBetter performance for range queries and bulk data retrievalBalanced performance for search, insert, and delete operationsMemory UsageRequires more memory for internal nodesRequires less memory as keys and values are stored in the same nodeIn order, to implement dynamic multilevel indexing, B-tree and B+ tree are generally employed. The drawback of the B-tree used for indexing, however, is that it stores the data pointer (a pointer to the disk file block containing the key value), corresponding to a particular key value, along with that key value in the node of a B-tree. This technique greatly reduces the number of entries that can be packed into a node of a B-tree, thereby contributing to the increase in the number of levels in the B-tree, hence increasing the search time of a record. B+ tree eliminates the above drawback by storing data pointers only at the leaf nodes of the tree. Thus, the structure of the leaf nodes of a B+ tree is quite different from the structure of the internal nodes of the B tree. It may be noted here that, since data pointers are present only at the leaf nodes, the leaf nodes must necessarily store all the key values along with their corresponding data pointers to the disk file block, in order to access them.Moreover, the leaf nodes are linked to providing ordered access to the records. The leaf nodes, therefore form the first level of the index, with the internal nodes forming the other levels of a multilevel index. Some of the key values of the leaf nodes also appear in the internal nodes, to simply act as a medium to control the searching of a record. From the above discussion, it is apparent that a B+ tree, unlike a B-tree, has two orders, ‘a’ and ‘b’, one for the internal nodes and the other for the external (or leaf) nodes.B+ TreesB+ Trees contain two types of nodes:Structure of  Internal NodeStructure of Lead NodeDiagram-II Using the Pnext pointer it is viable to traverse all the leaf nodes, just like a linked list, thereby achieving ordered access to the records stored in the disk.Tree PointerSearching Record in B+ TreesLet us suppose we have to find 58 in the B+ Tree. We will start by fetching from the root node then we will move to the leaf node, which might contain a record of 58. In the image given above, we will get 58 between 50 and 70. Therefore, we will we are getting a leaf node in the third leaf node and get 58 there. If we are unable to find that node, we will return that ‘record not founded’ message.Insertion in B+ Trees is done via the following steps.For more, refer to Insertion in a B+ Trees.Deletion in B+ Trees is just not deletion but it is a combined process of Searching, Deletion, and Balancing. In the last step of the Deletion Process, it is mandatory to balance the B+ Trees, otherwise, it fails in the property of B+ Trees.For more, refer to Deletion in B+ Trees.Answer:B+ Tree is balanced binary search tree that can simply be a B Tree, where data is stored in keys, not key-value pairs.Answer:The height of the B+ Trees is mostly balanced and is comparatively lesser than B-Trees.Answer:B+ Trees are often used for disk-based storage systems.S \n",

      " When it comes to searching and sorting data, one of the most fundamental data structures is the binary search tree. However, the performance of a binary search tree is highly dependent on its shape, and in the worst case, it can degenerate into a linear structure with a time complexity of O(n). This is where Red Black Trees come in, they are a type of balanced binary search tree that use a specific set of rules to ensure that the tree is always balanced. This balance guarantees that the time complexity for operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching is always O(log n), regardless of the initial shape of the tree.Red Black Trees are self-balancing, meaning that the tree adjusts itself automatically after each insertion or deletion operation. It uses a simple but powerful mechanism to maintain balance, by coloring each node in the tree either red or black.Red Black Tree-Red-Black tree is a binary search tree in which every node is colored with either red or black. It is a type of self balancing binary search tree. It has a good efficient worst case running time complexity.The Red-Black tree satisfies all the properties of binary search tree in addition to that it satisfies following additional properties –1. Root property: The root is black.2. External property: Every leaf (Leaf is a NULL child of a node) is black in Red-Black tree.3. Internal property: The children of a red node are black. Hence possible parent of red node is a black node.4. Depth property: All the leaves have the same black depth.5. Path property: Every simple path from root to descendant leaf node contains same number of black nodes.The result of all these above-mentioned properties is that the Red-Black tree is roughly balanced.Most of the BST operations (e.g., search, max, min, insert, delete.. etc) take O(h) time where h is the height of the BST. The cost of these operations may become O(n) for a skewed Binary tree. If we make sure that the height of the tree remains O(log n) after every insertion and deletion, then we can guarantee an upper bound of O(log n) for all these operations. The height of a Red-Black tree is always O(log n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree.“n” is the total number of elements in the red-black tree.Comparison with AVL Tree:The AVL trees are more balanced compared to Red-Black Trees, but they may cause more rotations during insertion and deletion. So if your application involves frequent insertions and deletions, then Red-Black trees should be preferred. And if the insertions and deletions are less frequent and search is a more frequent operation, then AVL tree should be preferred over the Red-Black Tree.How does a Red-Black Tree ensure balance?A simple example to understand balancing is, that a chain of 3 nodes is not possible in the Red-Black tree. We can try any combination of colors and see if all of them violate the Red-Black tree property.Proper structure of three noded Red-black treeBlack height is the number of black nodes on a path from the root to a leaf. Leaf nodes are also counted black nodes. From the above properties 3 and 4, we can derive, a Red-Black Tree of height h has black-height >= h/2.Number of nodes from a node to its farthest descendant leaf is no more than twice as the number of nodes to the nearest descendant leaf.Every Red Black Tree with n nodes has height <= 2Log2(n+1) This can be proved using the following facts:From the above points, we can conclude the fact that Red Black Tree with n nodes has a height <= 2Log2(n+1)As every red-black tree is a special case of a binary tree so the searching algorithm of a red-black tree is similar to that of a binary tree.Algorithm:For the program, you can refer it for AVL tree.Example: Searching 11 in the following red-black tree.Solution:Just follow the blue bubble.In this post, we introduced Red-Black trees and discussed how balance is ensured. The hard part is to maintain balance when keys are added and removed. We have also seen how to search an element from the red-black tree. We will soon be discussing insertion and deletion operations in coming posts on the Red-Black tree.1) Is it possible to have all black nodes in a Red-Black tree? 2) Draw a Red-Black Tree that is not an AVL tree structure-wise?Red-Black Tree Insertion Red-Black Tree Deletion \n",

      " The limitations of traditional binary search trees can be frustrating. Meet the B-Tree, the multi-talented data structure that can handle massive amounts of data with ease. When it comes to storing and searching large amounts of data, traditional binary search trees can become impractical due to their poor performance and high memory usage. B-Trees, also known as B-Tree or Balanced Tree, are a type of self-balancing tree that was specifically designed to overcome these limitations.Unlike traditional binary search trees, B-Trees are characterized by the large number of keys that they can store in a single node, which is why they are also known as “large key” trees. Each node in a B-Tree can contain multiple keys, which allows the tree to have a larger branching factor and thus a shallower height. This shallow height leads to less disk I/O, which results in faster search and insertion operations. B-Trees are particularly well suited for storage systems that have slow, bulky data access such as hard drives, flash memory, and CD-ROMs.B-Trees maintain balance by ensuring that each node has a minimum number of keys, so the tree is always balanced. This balance guarantees that the time complexity for operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching is always O(log n), regardless of the initial shape of the tree.Note: “n” is the total number of elements in the B-treeFollowing is an example of a B-Tree of minimum order 5 Note: that in practical B-Trees, the value of the minimum order is much more than 5.We can see in the above diagram that all the leaf nodes are at the same level and all non-leafs have no empty sub-tree and have keys one less than the number of their children.Traversal is also similar to Inorder traversal of Binary Tree. We start from the leftmost child, recursively print the leftmost child, then repeat the same process for the remaining children and keys. In the end, recursively print the rightmost child.Search is similar to the search in Binary Search Tree. Let the key to be searched is k.Searching a B-Tree is similar to searching a binary tree. The algorithm is similar and goes with recursion. At each level, the search is optimized as if the key value is not present in the range of the parent then the key is present in another branch. As these values limit the search they are also known as limiting values or separation values. If we reach a leaf node and don’t find the desired key then it will display NULL.Examples:Input: Search 120 in the given B-Tree.Solution:In this example, we can see that our search was reduced by just limiting the chances where the key containing the value could be present. Similarly if within the above example we’ve to look for 180, then the control will stop at step 2 because the program will find that the key 180 is present within the current node. And similarly, if it’s to seek out 90 then as 90 < 100 so it’ll go to the left subtree automatically, and therefore the control flow will go similarly as shown within the above example.Below is the implementation of the above approach:Note: The above code doesn’t contain the driver program. We will be covering the complete program in our next post on B-Tree Insertion.There are two conventions to define a B-Tree, one is to define by minimum degree, second is to define by order. We have followed the minimum degree convention and will be following the same in coming posts on B-Tree. The variable names used in the above program are also kept the sameInsertion and Deletion:B-Tree Insertion B-Tree DeletionPlease write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above. \n",
